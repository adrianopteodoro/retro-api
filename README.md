### How it works

- Upon first launch, you need to enter your login and API key in the "Login" section.
- The program sends a getUserProfile request to the API, and if such a user exists, it considers the data valid and stores it in the local storage.
- When you press the auto-update button, the program sends a getGameInfoAndUserProgress request and retrieves all achievements for the last launched game. Afterward, every 5 seconds a getUserProfile request is sent, and if TotalPoins or SoftcorePoints is mismatched, it get last achivs for 5 mins and refresh widgets.
